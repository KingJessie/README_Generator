  # **Project Description**
  Better Nutrient is a website that focuses on promoting healthy living. It provides users with the ability to search for a specific food of their choice, and in return, it displays the corresponding nutrients and recipe based on their input. This enables users to track their food intake to ensure they are obtaining the necessary nutrients they require daily.

  ## What I learned
  For the most part the newest part of building this page was learning to work in a team, take on smaller pieces of the whole, the process of give and take, as well as learning new aspects of GitHub - project side, the board, switching branches, pushing to main and accepting other team members pull requests. 

  ## Continued development
  For future development, our aim is to introduce a feature that provides users with healthy smoothie recipes to complement their healthy meal choices. Additionally, we will include a health and wellness blog to provide users with informative and educational articles on healthy eating and wellness.
