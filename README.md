# Description:
When launching an open source project on GitHub, it is essential to have a decent README for the application. This should cover the app's purpose, how to use the app, how to install the app, how to report issues, and how to contribute; this last section increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the project's success. 

<br>

## ***User Story***

<sub>As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.</sub>

<br>

## **Installation:**
The purpose of Inquirer.js is to provide a command-line interface for Node.js that is high quality and simple to integrate.

<br>

**Requirements:**
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [Inquirer.js](https://github.com/inquirer/inquirer.js)

- [x] Run Node.js applications from the command line.
- [x] Import and use the native fs module to read and write to the file system.
- [x] Install third-party modules like inquirer using npm.

```
# npm install inquirer:
npm init -y
npm install inquirer@^8.0.0
```

<br>

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.mjs
```

## Usage:
With this application, you can generate a README file quickly and effortlessly through a command-line interface. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.
